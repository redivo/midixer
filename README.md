# MIdiXER

MIdiXER (MIDI+MIXER) is an **open source** and **open hardware** MIDI controller surface project for DAWs.
It is based on things like
[PreSonus Faderport](https://intl.presonus.com/products/faderport-16-daw-controller),
[Mackie Control](https://mackie.com/en/products/controllers/mcu-pro-and-xt-pro) and
[Behringer X-TOUCH](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0808-AAD),
but not a clone of those.

The intent of this project is to build a well tested, easy to use, easy to extend and hardware
independent DAW controller, so anyone can fork it and extend the project to work based on any
hardware platform using the same core.

For more information about proposed hardwares and software please refer to
~~MIdiXER Hardware~~ *(Not implemented yet)* and [MIdiXER Software](software/README.md).
