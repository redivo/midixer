# Generic MIDI Software

This part of software implements and defines all things that are generic MIDI communication.

The main class is `MidiMsg` that represents a MIDI message with some getters and setters.

For more information about MIDI, please refer to the primary references that were used in this
implementation: [MIDI Association](https://midi.org) and
[sparkfun MIDI Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/midi-tutorial/introduction).
